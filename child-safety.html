    <h2>Our commitment</h2>
    <p>
      Hooly is a keyboard and messaging assistant. We do not operate a social
      network, dating platform, or public content feed. We are committed to
      protecting children and strictly prohibit any content that involves child
      sexual abuse or exploitation (CSAE).
    </p>

    <h2>Prohibited content</h2>
    <p>
      We do not allow the use of our app or services to create, request, share,
      or facilitate CSAE in any form. This includes any sexual content involving
      minors, grooming, or attempts to solicit such content.
    </p>

    <h2>Reporting and response</h2>
    <p>
      If we receive a report of CSAE-related activity involving our app or
      services, we will take appropriate action, which may include restricting
      access to AI features and cooperating with law enforcement as required by
      applicable law.
    </p>

    <h2>User reporting</h2>
    <p>
      If you suspect abuse or exploitation, please report it to the appropriate
      authorities in your country. In the United States, reports can be made to
      the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children (NCMEC) at
      <a href="https://report.cybertip.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
        https://report.cybertip.org/
      </a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Data handling</h2>
    <p>
      Hooly processes user-provided text and optional screenshots only to
      generate message suggestions. We do not provide public posting or sharing
      features within the app.
    </p>
